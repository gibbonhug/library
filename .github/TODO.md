# Todo

- Likely have to clean up old comments, docs from moving various things from App into children
- [Recommend random books or something](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api)
- Store data offline, think is part of Odin curriculum anyway
- Post request in custom hook, not just in AddForm (also catch errors)
- Change title of libraries when user deletes all books to be something disappointed.
