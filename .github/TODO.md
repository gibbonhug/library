## Features / Core
- [Recommend random books or something](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api)
- Gonna need a backend and stop hosting a live server at some point
- Post request in custom hook, not just in AddForm (also catch errors, currently not catching errors)

## Meta
- Type React Router things ?
- Likely have to clean up old comments, docs from moving various things from App into children
- Figure out design, where to take this. 'Goodreads clone' or something else?

## üëÅÔ∏è
- Make CSS less ugly 
- Change title of libraries when user deletes all books to be something disappointed.
