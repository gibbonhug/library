# Todo

- Likely have to clean up old comments, docs from moving various things from App into children
- [Recommend random books or something](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api)
- Store data offline, think is part of Odin curriculum anyway
- Post request in custom hook, not just in AddForm (also catch errors, currently not catching errors)
- Change title of libraries when user deletes all books to be something disappointed.
- Figure out design of site, where to take this. 'Goodreads clone' or something else?
- Make CSS less ugly
